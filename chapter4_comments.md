# Clean code chapter 4 comments

## Tips & Learnings
- Comments are a necessary evil
    - They can include misinformation, disruption, distraction but also explain good thing.
    - Comments get seperated from the original code.
- Comments do not make up for bad code
- Explain yourself in code.
- Legal comments
    - Copyright, authorship statements
- Informative comments
    - For regex 
- Explanation of intent for the code solution
- Clarification
- Warning of consequences 
    - Certain functions or programs can have huge consequences.
- TODO comments
    - Jobs that should be done but cannot be done at this moment.
- Amplicfication of a functions intent
- Noise comments
    - Provide no new information
- Dont use a comment when you can use a function or variable name
- Dont comment out code. -> people will leave it there.

## Own Opinion
I like the thought of comments being useless. The only reasons why I would use comments is for TODO's, possible business logic, and informative comments.
