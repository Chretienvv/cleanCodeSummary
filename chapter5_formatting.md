- Formatting and code principles are important to agree on within the team.
- The newspaper metaphor
    - Source files should be like a news paper article.
- whitelines are very important
- Vertical distance
    - A file should be like a manual. Step 1 continues to step 10 from top to bottom
- Where to place variables?
    - Different rules and practices. As close to the concept as possible
- Dependend functions should be close to eachother
- Keep lines short. NO hard limit but more thatn 120 is to much

## Own Opinion
I really like this subject because it is also about clear communication. My interest is with clean code  and how to write that. This really helps keeping things in perspective.
